          This was a school project that uses Amazon Web Services, C#, and MySQL. It provides a reservation system for a restaurant, allowing the restaurant to manage reservations and clients to make them remotely.

          In this project, I developed a web crawler in <mark>python</mark> that searches for a PC component on three websites. It gathers the prices from all results and saves the cheapest option from each site to a PDF, also providing the corresponding link. Additionally, it stores the information for future use, so if the program is executed again, it compares the current prices with previous ones and sends an email notification if the price has decreased.

          During my time at CETI I got the foundations of my technical knowledge. I would say that I became a hard worker during my stay at CETI.
